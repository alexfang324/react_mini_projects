This is a React.js app that display image search results in compact forms using CSS grid and calculate the number of rows each image to span across dynamically using state system and render. The styling of the web page is done with CSS and Semantic UI. The intention was to practice using State System and Lifecycle methods instead of the Hook System. You can start this app with Node.js by first downloading the dependencies using the command "npm install" and then start the app with "npm start".
